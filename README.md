# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Visualizing Earthquakes with GeoJSON data

The purpose of this project is to use earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API to explore trends of earthquakes around the world with an interactive map. The earthquake data is plotted showing magnitude with color and size of the marker. In addition the tectonic plate lines are also plotted to allow the user to see the relationship between earthquakes and tectonic plates.

## Results
The map results in three views, Street, Satellite, and Dark as seen below.
